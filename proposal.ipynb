    "Pulsars emit two beams of light in opposite directions. Although the beam's light is steady, pulsars appear to flicker because they rotate.  As the pulsar rotates, the light beam may sweep over the Earth, swinging in and out of view, creating the impression that the pulsar is blinking to an astronomer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because pulsars are important space objects that allow scientists to study extreme states of matter and cosmic events, it would be great if we had a system to predict whether a particular space object is a pulsar. Therefore, can we use the information from the data set to create a model that can predict a pulsar star?\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set contains nine columns. Eight continuous variables and one class variable. The first four variables are statistics derived from a pulsar’s integrated pulse profile, which are unique to a pulsar, whereas the latter four are derived from the DM-SNR (Dispersion Measure of Signal Noise Ratio).\n",
